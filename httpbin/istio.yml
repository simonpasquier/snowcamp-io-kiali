# This specification defines that the default Istio ingress gateway should
# handle traffic for httpbin.snowcamp.example.com:80.
#
# The virtual service tells the Istio ingress gateway to forward requests
# matching the /headers and /status/* locations to the (Kubernetes)
# app.httpbin service. Requests not matching the conditions will be
# answered with 404.
#
# Note that the gateway and virtual service are created in the istio-system namespace (same
# as the Istio gateway) while the application runs in the httpbin namespace.
#
# See app.yml to deploy the httpbin application and expose it as the app.httpbin service.
